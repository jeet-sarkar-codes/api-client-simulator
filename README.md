# API Client Simulator

This is a lightweight Python script that simulates API interactions with a backend. It sends GET requests to defined endpoints and parses the JSON response for testing or monitoring.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python 3.12
- `requests` library
- Localhost testing against Flask APIs

## ⚙️ Features
- Connects to `/status` and `/run-diagnostics`
- Prints structured JSON outputs
- Handles basic exception scenarios

## 📁 Project Files
- `client.py` – API interaction script
- `README.md` – Project guide

## 📌 Notes
Designed to reinforce client-server architecture understanding and API consumption logic. Acts as a test companion for my Flask backend projects.
